# Semantic Segmentation for Urban Scene Understanding

This repository contains the source code for project done as the part of the Neural Networks course at master's academic studies in Computing and Control Engineering, Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad. 


We focused on examining the predictive performance of encoder-decoder based architectures trained on ResNet and Inception based encoders, as well as novel encoder pretrained to reconstruct urban scene images Our approaches and result are described [here](https://github.com/milica-skipina/semantic-segmentation/blob/main/NN_Skipina_Batic.pdf).
